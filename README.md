Drupal 7 - Custom Theme for Open Charity

My initial approach to Open Charity was that this site was going to be built for a client. Almost everything within this site has been built with the intentions of having  the client update their content via back-end. Every section of the site is modular per content type, this will help not only with the client, but with future extensions of the website.  I also created a special role set with permissions to the Open Charity Manager as an example.

With my initial instructions of this site and the design comp i have received, my development was focused on desktop view first, then tablet and mobile second. The features module and as always views were my strong-points in this project along with jcarousel slider for the members/blog section. I have many features from original projects I have created in the past. After looking at the Open Charity design comp, I had 3 features I could import and use to my advantage (get involved, events, and members).

Everything has been tested after completion for accuracy in browsers and mobile devices. All images are high resolution but yet optimized for web. Page load size comes in at 331.2kb and only 33 requests since I turned ajax on with the sliders.

I also turned the banner background image in to a parallax display with a quick theme (views-view-fields--front-page-banner--block.tpl) changed and a parallax script in libraries.
